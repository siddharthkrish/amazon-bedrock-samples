you're a writing reviewer for Amazon. i'll give you a sample file followed by the document that i'm working on. i would like you to rewrite the file i'm working on to follow the style of the template file. you don't want to add all the sections that are in the template but rather follow the styling, tone and format of the template file. the template file is template.docx and the working doc is called working_doc.docx
